##  User Stories & Wireframes

Users will enter application through the home page/index route. Index Route will show a header section and a main content section. Header is comprised of company/application logo name and slogan, as well as the nav bar. Main content section will display resource categories along with a short description of the category. Following the main content section users will see a "quote of the day" block followed by a footer with company information.

From the index route users have two options of where to go next, the "About" section using the link or the nav bar or to a resource list of a specified category. On the show route for the about section users will be able to learn more about the company/application before returning to the home/index route using the nav link.

When users select a resource category they will be linked to the show route for the category. Users will then be able to see all available resources for that category along with a short description of that resource. From there users may either click the desired resource link and be directed to a 3rd party website to consume the resource or they may print off a PDF document containing the JSON data of each resource.

Users will also have the ability, from any page, to get an extra quote of the day as a downloadable pdf that contains a QR code that can be scanned from anywhere and accesses the Freescource Library application.
